# Voucher Seat Assignment App

A simple full-stack app for assigning seats to voucher holders.  
The backend is built with **Go**, and the frontend uses **React + Tailwind (Flowbite)**.

## Getting Started

This app runs locally on:

- **Frontend**: Vite will try `http://localhost:5173` by default,  
  but it may fall back to another port (like `5174`, `5175`, etc.) if it's already in use.  
  Check the terminal log after running the script to see the exact URL.

- **Backend**: `http://localhost:8080` (default Go server)

Before running the script, **grant execution permission**:
```bash
chmod +x dev.sh
```   

And then run it
```bash
./dev.sh
```
